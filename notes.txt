IsWindowVisible() - for checking if the window still exists

Core prog geometry:

core driver
	core prog
		input verifier/opener
		output checksum adder

Needed data for the core driver:

any relevant filename/blocksize fields
will lock/unlock on its own

Needed data for the core prog:

filenames, progress bar sub (if there is one), progress bar update sub, status bar update sub, NOT just hwnds!

Needed data for input verifier/opener

filenames, streams as reference, output filesize and blocksize (if relevant)

Needed data for output checksum adder

stream
filesize



Many different layers - main GUI, GUI interface, file interface, data interface


Traverse logic - 

if there's a link to the left, take it
	return the called function
  else
	if there's a link to the right, 
	  else
